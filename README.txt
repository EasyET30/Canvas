This was a full-stack C#/.NET project that I created within a single semester at FSU. 

I started the semester without any background knowledge of C# or .NET.
I was pushed to my full potential to learn a variety of new programming languages, syntax, and concepts within a short period of time.(C#, .NET, XAML, REST APIs, singletons, JSON and the full-stack pipeline)

I put a massive amount of time and effort into this project. My professor, Dr. Christopher Mills, recognized that I had the best project out of the whole class and offered to write me a letter of recomendation.

The project consists of three different directories that all correspond to the full-stack. 
"Canvas" is the front-end portion that was created using the .NET MAUI framework consisting of C# and XAML. 
"Canvas_Database" is the back-end database that saves the data into JSON files for persistence.
"Canvas_API" is the REST APIs and controllers that connect the front and back together.
